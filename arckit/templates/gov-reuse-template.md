**Recommended Strategy**: [Direct reuse / Fork and adapt / Use as reference /
Discard]

**Key Considerations**:

- [Consideration 1: e.g., Requires upgrade from Python 3.8 to 3.12]
- [Consideration 2: e.g., Missing authentication module — must add]
- [Consideration 3: e.g., Tested in GDS infrastructure, may need adaptation]

## Dependency Overlap Analysis

Pairwise dependency-overlap between candidate repositories (from the
govreposcrape SBOM graph via `dependency_compare`). High overlap signals that
two candidates are near-duplicates or forks of a common codebase — reuse one,
not both, to avoid double-counting effort savings.

| Repo A       | Repo B       | Shared Deps | Unique to A | Unique to B | Overlap % | Assessment                  | Citation   |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| [org/repo-a] | [org/repo-b] | [931]       | [412]       | [268]       | [51.2%]   | [Distinct / ⚠️ Likely fork] | [CITATION] |

**Notes**: [Where two candidates are near-duplicates (≥ 60% overlap), the
higher-scored repo is the primary recommendation and the other is noted as "see
also". Omit this section's table if fewer than two candidates shared a
capability.]

## Gap Analysis

| Capability     | Status      | Notes                                   | Recommended Action            |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Capability 1] | ✅ Reusable | Strong candidate found — [Repo Name]    | Fork and integrate            |
| [Capability 2] | ⚠️ Partial  | Candidate covers 60% of requirements    | Adapt [Repo Name] + fill gaps |
| [Capability 3] | ✅ Reusable | Direct reuse possible with minor config | Use [Repo Name] as-is         |
| [Capability 4] | ❌ No match | No suitable government code found       | Build new component           |
| [Capability 5] | ⚠️ Partial  | Outdated — last commit 18 months ago    | Fork and modernise            |

**Legend**: ✅ Reusable &nbsp;|&nbsp; ⚠️ Partial &nbsp;|&nbsp; ❌ No match

## Recommendations

### Reuse Strategy Summary

[2-3 paragraph narrative summarising the overall recommended approach to reuse,
explaining which candidates are most valuable, the level of adaptation required,
and how reuse supports the project timeline and budget goals.]

### Implementation Priority

| Priority | Repository  | Capability   | Action                         | Estimated Effort | Timeline   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 1        | [Repo Name] | [Capability] | [Fork / Integrate / Configure] | [X days]         | [Sprint X] |
| 2        | [Repo Name] | [Capability] | [Fork / Integrate / Configure] | [X days]         | [Sprint Y] |
| 3        | [Repo Name] | [Capability] | [Fork / Integrate / Configure] | [X days]         | [Sprint Z] |
| 4        | —           | [Capability] | Build new                      | [X days]         | [Sprint W] |

### Risk Considerations

| Risk                                                       | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidate repository abandoned before integration complete | Medium     | High   | Pin to specific commit; plan for fallback build  |
| License incompatibility discovered post-fork               | Low        | High   | Legal review before deep integration             |
| Tech stack divergence requires significant adaptation      | Medium     | Medium | Spike/prototype before committing to reuse       |
| Upstream breaking changes after fork                       | Low        | Medium | Evaluate upstream dependency management strategy |
