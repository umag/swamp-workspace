## Executive Summary

**Purpose**: This document assesses whether the project's decided architecture
(ADRs, principles) conforms to the designed/implemented architecture (HLD, DLD,
DevOps). This is a point-in-time conformance check for the [PHASE] phase gate
review.

**Scope**: [N] conformance checks executed across [N] ADRs, [N] principles, and
[N] design artifacts.

**Overall Conformance Score**: [X]%

| Result          | Count | Description                     |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------- |
| ✅ PASS         | [N]   | Check satisfied with evidence   |
| ❌ FAIL         | [N]   | Conformance violation detected  |
| ⚪ NOT ASSESSED | [N]   | Insufficient artifacts to check |

**Overall Recommendation**: [CONFORMANT / CONFORMANT WITH CONDITIONS /
NON-CONFORMANT]

**Deviation Tiers** (FAIL findings only):

| Tier                  | Count | Response                                          |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 RED — Escalate     | [N]   | Blocks next gate — escalate to architecture board |
| 🟡 YELLOW — Negotiate | [N]   | Remediate within 30 days or agree fallback        |
| 🟢 GREEN — Acceptable | [N]   | Document and monitor — no blocking action         |

[IF NON-CONFORMANT:] **Critical Conformance Gaps**:

1. [Check ID] — [Brief description of failure]
2. [Repeat for each RED finding]

**Action Required**: Escalate RED findings to architecture board before
proceeding to next gate.

[IF CONFORMANT WITH CONDITIONS:] **Conditions Noted**: No RED findings — [N]
YELLOW findings require remediation by [next gate date].

[IF CONFORMANT:] **All checks passed** — architecture conforms to decisions and
principles.

## Appendix: Conformance Check Methodology

### Check Severity Levels

| Severity   | Meaning                                                         | Action Required                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **HIGH**   | Critical conformance violation — architecture integrity at risk | Immediate remediation before next gate  |
| **MEDIUM** | Notable deviation — architecture drift detected                 | Remediation within 30 days or next gate |
| **LOW**    | Informational — acknowledged debt being tracked                 | Monitor and review quarterly            |

### ATD Categories

| Category           | Description                                        | Typical Source                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| DEFERRED-FIX       | Known deficiency deferred to later phase           | ADR consequences, review conditions        |
| ACCEPTED-RISK      | Risk consciously accepted as trade-off             | Risk register, ADR trade-offs              |
| WORKAROUND         | Temporary solution deviating from intended pattern | DLD, DevOps strategy                       |
| DEPRECATED-PATTERN | Superseded pattern not yet migrated                | Superseded ADRs                            |
| SCOPE-REDUCTION    | Quality/feature removed for timeline/budget        | Requirements changes, sprint reviews       |
| EXCEPTION          | Approved principle exception with expiry           | Exception register, compliance assessments |

### Deviation Tiers

| Tier                  | Criteria               | Required Response                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔴 RED — Escalate     | FAIL + HIGH severity   | Explain risk, provide alternative approach, escalate to architecture board/CTO |
| 🟡 YELLOW — Negotiate | FAIL + MEDIUM severity | Specific remediation steps + timeline, fallback position if deferred           |
| 🟢 GREEN — Acceptable | FAIL + LOW severity    | Document deviation rationale, set review date, no blocking action              |

### Conformance Scoring

- **CONFORMANT** (100%): All checks PASS or NOT ASSESSED
- **CONFORMANT WITH CONDITIONS** ( >= 80%): No RED findings, YELLOW/GREEN
  findings have remediation plans
- **NON-CONFORMANT** ( < 80% or any RED finding): Critical gaps requiring
  immediate action

### Evidence Referencing Convention

All findings reference source artifacts using: `file:section:line` format.

- Example: `decisions/ARC-001-ADR-001-v1.0.md:Decision:15` — ADR file, Decision
  section, line 15
- Example: `vendors/acme/hld-v1.md:4.2 Security:156-203` — HLD file, section
  4.2, lines 156-203
